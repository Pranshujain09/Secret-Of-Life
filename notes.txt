  ##### This is wrong #####
  app.post("/submit", (req,res)=>{
     console.log(req.body);
     app.use(checkPass);
 })



 When defining a route handler, you should use the  middleware using the app.use() method outside of the route handler
 or you can do this:


app.post("/submit", checkPass, (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body);
  });
